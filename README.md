## Matthew Warnock

love building well tested, clean and solid code. I get a lot of satisfaction from learning new techniques that enable me to improve the readability and efficiency of code. I found my joy in coding by working on projects with my mentor and getting regular PR reviews. Throughout my career I have always been proactive with self-development by learning new technologies in my spare time. This drew me to audio/visual sales because I would spend most my spare time looking at reviews and technical info for fun. I am driven to understand the details so that I can be better prepared to help others.

## Skills

#### Meticulous

- During my time at John Henry's it was very important that every single moving piece of hardware was tested thoroughly. Due to the detailed testing I would do and the training I implemented as a result, the company saved on transport costs and time.

#### Analytical planner

- When project managing at Bang and Olufsen I discovered that problem solving time sensitive issues is just a matter of going though the right process a step at a time. I would then review to see if we need to add or improve a process. This resulted in less callouts to the customers.

#### Critical thinker

- During my time at Wembley Music Centre we would often have pitches from manufacturing companies on new e-kits, boasting new 'revolutionary' technologies.
I would spend time investing such claims carefully to ascertain the facts. This resulted in my boss avoiding taking on new products that had a weaker USP than existing stock.
